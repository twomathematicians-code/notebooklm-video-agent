Excited to share my latest open-source project! 🚀

"Podcast Video Creation from PPT and Audio" is an AI-powered 
tool that automatically converts audio content into professional 
YouTube videos by synchronizing it with PowerPoint slides.

As someone who creates educational content, I know the pain of 
manually syncing slides with audio. This tool reduces 2-4 hours 
of work to just 5 minutes.

Key Features:
• Automatic slide synchronization
• AI-generated captions using Whisper
• YouTube Shorts support
• 4K video rendering
• Completely free and open source

Whether you're using NotebookLM, recording podcasts, or creating 
online courses, this tool can save you hours.

Would love your feedback and contributions!

[Project] I built an AI tool that turns audio + PowerPoint into YouTube videos

Hey everyone!

I created an open-source Python tool that automatically converts 
audio files (from NotebookLM, podcasts, or recordings) into 
professional YouTube videos by syncing them with PowerPoint slides.

**Why I built it:**
I love NotebookLM's AI podcasts, but creating videos from them 
took hours. Now it takes 5 minutes.

**How it works:**
1. Upload your audio file
2. Add your slide images
3. AI syncs them together
4. Generates captions automatically
5. Outputs YouTube-ready video

**GitHub:** https://github.com/twomathematicians-code/podcast-video-creation-from-ppt-and-audio

Would appreciate any feedback, stars, or contributions!
🎯 Why This Name Works
"Podcast Video Creation from PPT and Audio"
✅ SEO-friendly - Contains keywords people search for
✅ Descriptive - Clearly explains what it does
✅ Broad appeal - Not just for NotebookLM, works for any audio+slides
✅ Professional - Sounds like a complete solution
✅ Easy to remember - Follows "Action + Source + Output" format
Alternative names considered:
❌ NotebookLM Video Agent (too narrow, only for NotebookLM)
❌ Audio to Video Converter (too generic, doesn't mention slides)
❌ Slide Sync Tool (doesn't mention audio/podcasts)
✅ Podcast Video Creation from PPT and Audio (perfect balance!)
